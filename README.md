 # Data science and machine learning projects

## Resources, exercises and projects from the 'Applied ML and Data Science with Python' course (March, 2020) at Emory University (tought by Sridhar Palle, Ph.D)

These are primarily Jupyter notebooks using Anacaonda.

 ### bank_marketing
 ### (Capstone project)

We will use a marketing/banking dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

The dataset is related to phone call marketing campaigns of Portugese banking institutions.

The goal is to find the most accurate model that predicts whether the client will subsribe to a term deposit or not.
The target variable, y is a yes/no.

We will use sklearn for
 - pre-processing,
 - splitting data for train/test
 - comparing 4 models (DummyClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier)
 - comparing metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, f1, precision, auc)
